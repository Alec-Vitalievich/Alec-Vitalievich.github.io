# My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Alec-Vitalievich/Sunleaf-Journey" target="_blank">Sunleaf Journey: Quest for the Sun</a></h3>
    <p>Sunleaf Journey is a platforming game made in SFML 2.6.2_1 with C++ to demonstrate understanding of OOP principles. The project involved collaboration with two other members to complete a project of choosing within 3 weeks.</p>
